This code is an implementation of pulse width modulation (PWM) in vhdl. Specifically, it implements PWM
to control a servo motor at a frequency of 50Hz and at a counter and transition rate of 0 to 1000000. The input
to the board, that is transition is made using 7 switches. The transition is to be made between values 
250000 and 500000. The minimum output value corresponding to the 250000 transition value is 105.
